FOR ALL TRANSLATORS
======================

If you want to contribute, get Qt Linguist: http://qt-apps.org/content/show.php/Qt+Linguist+Download?content=89360

All of the strings you need to translate are in bbdownloader_.ts. When you're done, save it as bbdownloader_(LANGUAGE CODE) and send it to me somehow.

For all language codes: https://developer.blackberry.com/playbook/native/reference/com.qnx.doc.dinkum/topic/cpp/localedefs.html
