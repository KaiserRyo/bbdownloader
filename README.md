==========
An OS/radio link generator, automatic lookup tool, certification/metadata browser, etc. for BlackBerry 10

## Requirements
* BlackBerry OS 10.3.1 (as of 5.1.0)

2. Perform OS/software lookups across all 5 servers (plus availability checking for production)
3. Generate EScreens codes
4. Browse Momentics metadata/PTCRB certifications
5. Text/file hashing
6. Creation of blank icons/nomedia files
7. System information (including all those hard to reach text files)
8. Be a good Cascades example
9. All of the above, for free :)

## Building
