FOR ALL TRANSLATORS
======================

If you want to contribute, get Qt Linguist: https://github.com/thurask/Qt-Linguist/releases/latest

All of the strings you need to translate are in bbdownloader.ts. When you're done, save it as bbdownloader_(LANGUAGE CODE) and send it to me somehow (preferably GitHub pull request).

For all language codes: https://developer.blackberry.com/playbook/native/reference/com.qnx.doc.dinkum/topic/cpp/localedefs.html
